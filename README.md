# metallurgy

A python project for analysis and synthesis of steelpan audio.

The goal of this project is to create a system that can analyze audio input consisting of steelpan performance and then reconstruct the input using the project's built-in library of steelpan samples and DSP techniques.

## Requirements

(TODO: complete this section)

This project requires a Python environment with the following packages:
- Essentia
- numpy
- scipy
- librosa
- wavio

This project also utilizes a library of steelpan samples. This collection is not appropriate for hosting on GitHub. The zip file can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10HNMlqnlRHWyO0_6WnyOjbK_xfR4K3Qc/view?usp=sharing).
You should download this collection and unzip it to the `metallurgy/Audio` directory.
