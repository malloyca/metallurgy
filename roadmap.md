# Development Roadmap

## TODO List
- 
  
## From meeting with George
- Make more Audio test examples
  - Make MIDI versions
  - Make function to convert MIDI file to numpy array version for comparison
- Pitch detection algorithm comparison (makes each notebook file)
- Write report (Write about each project, background: onset detection, pitch detection and Steelpan acoustics)
- Longer term project: evaluate pitch detection algorithms on the steelpan

## Future plans:
- Machine learning based pitch detection system.
  - The pitch detection algorithms included in Essentia are failing on the test input (which is Twinkle Twinkle Little Star).
  - There is clearly room for improvement in this area.
  - We should devise an ML and/or deep learning based steelpan pitch detection system to test against the Essentia (and/or Librosa?) algorithms.
- Do other awesome work.
